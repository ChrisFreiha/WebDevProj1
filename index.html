		<h2 id="h1proj1About">About Me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Chris Freiha, as stated above, and I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like being outdoors and being active, but I also like spending time inside playing video 
			games and discovering new things technology can do. <br> A good balance of both is preferred. 
		</p>

		<h2 id="h2proj1Hobbies">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
		<p>
			Some of my favorite hobbies include going to the beach, hanging out with my close friends, and 
			cooking food.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a huge <a class="link1proj1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars" target="_blank">
			Jacksonville Jaguars</a> fan and always will be. No matter how much they let me down on Sundays, I 
			will still support my hometown team. Go Jags!
		</p>

		<h2 id="h3proj1Edu">Education</h2>
		<p>
			I attended and graduated from <a class="link2proj1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Kenny_High_School" 
			target="_blank">Bishop Kenny High School</a> in Jacksonville, Florida and had interests in 
			mechanical engineering. I then started my college career 
			at <a class="link3proj1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Florida" target="_blank">
			University of North Florida</a> and pursued engineering for over two years.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a little over two years, I discovered that the engineering path was not for me. While still 
			having a challenging and useful degree, I chose Information Technology as an alternative. IT having 
			a lot of the same prerequisites as engineering also helped influence me to choose this degree.
